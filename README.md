# RUN! MATCHSTICK MAN

![Game Screenshot](image/screenshot.png) <!-- Optional: Add a screenshot of your game -->

## Description
**RUN! MATCHSTICK MAN** is an interactive game developed using Python and Pygame. The game features a stickman character (Marie) who must navigate through obstacles while learning to make optimal decisions using Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. The project demonstrates the integration of multimedia elements (audio and images) and generates visual outputs stored in the `result_pic` folder.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Control Marie to jump over obstacles and reach the finish line.
- **Q-learning AI**: Marie learns to make decisions (e.g., jump, move left/right) using a Q-learning algorithm.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Randomly generated obstacles (missiles and pipes) with varying speeds.
- **Multimedia Integration**: Background music, sound effects, and visual feedback.
- **Visualization**: Real-time plotting of Q-learning metrics (e.g., average reward, exploration rate).

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory: 
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
3. Install the required dependencies:  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. Run the main script to start the game: 
    ```bash
    python marie.py
    
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the game.

3. The game will display real-time Q-learning metrics and save visualizations in the result_pic folder.

##  Q-learning Implementation

The game uses Q-learning to train Marie to make optimal decisions. Key parameters include:

1. Learning Rate (alpha): Controls how quickly the agent learns.

2. Discount Factor (gamma): Determines the importance of future rewards.

3. Exploration Rate (epsilon): Balances exploration and exploitation.


The Q-learning algorithm updates the Q-table based on the following formula:

```bash
Q[state][action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[new_state]) - Q[state][action])
```
## Visualization

The game includes real-time visualization of Q-learning metrics:

1. __Average Reward:__ Tracks the average reward per episode.

2. __Average Q-value:__ Tracks the average Q-value per episode.

3. __Exploration Rate (epsilon):__ Tracks the decay of the exploration rate.

4. __Success Count:__ Tracks the number of successful episodes.
